Essex,BT,2021-12-31,1 star,2 stars,,1 star,"BT is a disappointment!  I have made a new order with BT on Black Friday. The gentleman who spoke to me was extremely polite and helpful and gave a good deal. Nonetheless, I have waited 30 days to have my money back service up and running, and the day before my service is supposed to go live, I Called BT.   I called BT and explained that an engineer has been booked (since the end of November) to complete some work and install the required equipment, for my service to go live tomorrow. During the call, I was presented with new information that the engineers have been trying to contact the building management society, since the 1st of December, and have not obtained a response.   I explained to the advisor on the phone that I should have been notified of what is going on, so I could have made the required arrangements to sort out this issue. I also stated that it has been 30 days and that in the last 2 weeks, BT employees have been conduction research/work in my residential area. I mentioned that I was failing to understand why they did not notice that something was NOT right. My point is, I am not the only BT customer in Essex; if they are sending letters and not receiving a response from the building society, is there no other way to contact them? Could they not have sent an email or called them? I asked the advisor and he stated that he received a 'note' from the engineer at ""1 minute ago"" stating that "" they tried to contact the building management 3x and if they do not receive a response the order will be cancelled"". I now ask if they can write a letter and send it so swiftly, could they have NOT avoided this issue?!   I am extremely disappointed and shocked that BT has this level of lack of professionalism and sense of responsibility. The advisor enquired if I, the customer, could chase up the building management and seek authorization so they can conduct their work. It is not my responsibility to do their work, and it is quite outrageous that he proposed that to me. I clearly said that I would not do it as it is their responsibility and duty to get the required authorizations and provide me with solutions and not problems.   I was told that if the issue is not resolved by 10/01/2022, my order will be cancelled and a new order out through.   I now have to wait 10 days for this issue to be resolved when if BT and its engineers had been professional and provided good customer service, we could have come up with better solutions for both parties.   I regret to say that BT has proven to be as bad and as appalling as other internet providers and that customers should be aware of lack of professionalism and customer service skills."
Shrewsbury,BT,2021-12-30,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,Was receiving poor download speed and BT decided to send out an engineer. I asked whether I should call and cancel the appointment if the problem resolved itself and was told no. Engineer arrived and the problem had resolved itself. BT engineer made a passing comment about a 3rd party extender we use for a games console but as the only device connected to this is a games console and not the two laptops (laptop always uses an Ethernet cable into the modem) it wasnât an issue. Next month we receive an Â£85 bill stating that the engineer (not employed by BT but a company named qube) said that the extender was causing the problem. Spoke with BT who will not do anything stating that they can only go of the notes from a 3rd party engineer. Effectively being charged Â£85 for having a 3rd party booster in the house. Now told the only way to get a refund is to speak with this 3rd party company and have them change the notes? Although we have been given no contact details for them.
Warrigton Cheshire,BT,2021-12-30,5 stars,,,,Always very helpful today they sorted out a problem regarding a scam call and refunded cost. Well done BT
Tamworth,BT,2021-12-28,1 star,1 star,2 stars,2 stars,"Talk complete rubbish, tell you everything you want to hear and deliver nothink. Dont waist your time to customer service, you will be on hold for ever to then be cut off. Will be switching definitely."
Sleaford,BT,2021-12-24,1 star,4 stars,1 star,1 star,Ordered broadband for 13th of December.Doesnt work even now on 24th of december.

RM16,BT,2021-12-23,1 star,3 stars,3 stars,1 star,"Probably the worst service provider to our home.Lost count how many times broadband has crashed, requiring a phone call to get restarted.Have no option than to find a new broadband provider."
york,BT,2021-12-22,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,the worst service I have ever experienced After switching from sky we are back with sky with in one month Absolute garbidge BAD BAD BAD BAD no stars is the rating they deserve
Reading,BT,2021-12-22,4 stars,4 stars,4 stars,4 stars,"Pros are  being a big company, you can always speak to customser service, they will try to help and will send engineer.  Broadband quality is generally OK and reliable.   Cons are they are expensive and  Also they are hopeless at house moves.  something always goes wrong."
Dudley,BT,2021-12-16,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,Really bad company Internet is very slow at some points I was only getting 3mg ring up tell you what you what you want to hear and then do nothing to sort it this went on for 3 years now with sky loads better 60gb minimum now bt are trying to say I ow them money I don't think so considering they never met there end of the deal
,BT,2021-12-15,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"AVOID!!!If i could rate it O i would.Had our activation day on the 6th ofDecember and I am still here with no internet.Booked in an engineer visit for the 9th.Nobody showed up. Called in to book anotherone, and they forgot to actually book in theappointment.We were supposed to have another engineervisit today on the 15th and the engineer didnot show up again. When i called in they couldnot explain the situation.Worst customer service i have ever seen in mylife. Agents replying in a rude manner raisingtheir voices at us.No compensation for missed time of work orextra mobile data cost.We've been here with no internet for almost 2weeks.To anybody who is thinking of switching tobt.AVOID AVOID AVOID"
Chepstow,BT,2021-12-09,2 stars,3 stars,1 star,1 star,"They try hard when you manage to work out how to speak to a real person, but in our area, given that BT has owned the entire network for ever and paid out billons to shareholders, coverage and speed is shockingly third world. Also, if they want to get rid of all their employees as all companies obviously want to, you'd have thought they'd have made sure their 'fault bot' actually works. We reported a fault using the automated service and when no-one turned up we checked with a real person - they had no record of the fault. What a shower."
Bardsey,BT,2021-12-06,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"We are held hostage to the incompetence, unreliability and deplorably poor service from Bloody Terrible (BT)The norm is for them to wrongly schedule in a repair engineer and then fail to show - over charge by 100% per month and gaslight you when you try to get them to correct their mistakes Our âsuper-fastâWifi is super slow and regularly drops out. Yet they charge more and wrongly advertise that they have the best service. They really have the worst serviceNEVER get BT - they simply do not care and treat you with contempt and then try to upswell to you when you complain Itâs shocking that the spectacularly Open Reach service provider us the same supplier to 90% of Telecomms firms. That is simply a corrupt and massively inefficient monopoly"
Here,BT,2021-12-04,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"Terrible, the speeds and stuff are fine, but the router goes of about 20 times every 2 hours Don't use bt."
"Crawleyside, Stanhope",BT,2021-11-30,1 star,1 star,,,"Planned our entire house move around when BT could connect us, only to find on the day out that âsignificant workâ needs doing to the cabinet. Surely they knew this when the accepted our business? As we both work from home, connection is vital. Now weâre unable to work. Thanks BT."
Newtownards,BT,2021-11-28,1 star,1 star,4 stars,4 stars,"Woeful, abysmal customer service. They wanted me to return the router as they were sending me a new one. kept getting constant texts to return the old router. Had to phone customer services numerous times to get jiffy bag to send it back. BT store in local shopping centre didnt have them. Got proof of postage from post office. The texts still kept on coming, then a final bill for Â£50 for not returning the kit. Absolute Joke, stay away from them, customer service are awful they don't care one bit about you or your problems. Line speed good and and at speeds as advertised, but would never return on principle. Please give them a huge swerve and go elsewhere."
Gloucestershire,BT,2021-11-24,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,BT have the worst customer service I have ever come across. No one in their many offices are properly trained or know what they are doing. We have had problems from the very start. Kept being told different things. Engineers either not turning up for appointments or knocking on the door to come inside to check equipment. I will never recommend this company and will always discourage anyone (even my enemies) from using BT.
,BT,2021-11-24,4 stars,4 stars,4 stars,4 stars,Overall my experience has been good. (we haven't used it for gaming/heavy browsing)
TOTNES,BT,2021-11-22,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,Bt are awful - terrible communication. I wanted to leave then offered another contract low price with nothing said about being charged over Â£200. Honestly avoid use another
wakefield,BT,2021-11-19,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"Very poor service inspite of being with BT for many years.They will start troubling your broadband if you move to a new provider at least for week or 10 days before the move.Absolutely rubbish customer service"
Stockport,BT,2021-11-14,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,Shambles of a company. I couldn`t use the Broadband due to unforseen circumstances. Bt said no problem they would send a return bag for the router and there would be no charges. 3 months and 3 phone calls later i have been charged Â£50 with no return bag sent. I have asked for a return address to send the kit back but they won`t give me one. Total rip off company
Kirkcaldy,BT,2021-11-14,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"The service they provide is not close to that which is advertised. The internet speed is shockingly bad and periodically goes down for whole weekends. We have complained many times, however, their customer assistants are useless and unable to help in the slightest. One of the poorest service providers i have ever been with. Would not recommend to anyone who cares about broadband speed, consistency or customer care."
"Surrey, UK",BT,2021-11-12,1 star,1 star,4 stars,4 stars,"Existing BT customer here, just looking to change the point the internet cable comes into the house, as part of a refurb. Organised a date with BT 2 weeks ago for an engineer to come and do this. We were given a window of 8am-1pm. No one here by 12.30, so we rang BT customer services and were promised an engineer was on their way and were just held-up. My wife stayed in for the rest of the afternoon, with our 3 young boys, holding up the refurb work, only for no engineer to appear.  We ring BT this evening to understand how no one can appear and how the guidance at midday was that someone was on their way, only to be told that this was booked as a remote service and no one was ever going to come.  Absolutely shocking service. Building works held-up and canât even find an apology, let alone a suitable revised date for the work.  Will now be leaving the service and would strongly recommend anyone assessing different suppliers to avoid BT. Their service is shockingly bad for such a high profile company."
Reading,BT,2021-11-09,1 star,1 star,1 star,3 stars,Went for a deal with free Fitbit and âGreat Wi-Fiâ in every room. 3 months on no Fitbit with no help from customer service after several calls and emails. Multiple rooms without any Wi-Fi even though they are 10 meters away from the main Hub.
Sutton Coldfield,BT,2021-11-09,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"I have taken BT superfibre connection to my work from home. It is the worst decision I made. There was an inordinate delay in getting the connection. (Then 3 blokes came in 3 vans to put ONE wire from the road to the house. One did the work the other 2 merrily chatting away) I wish  Virgin was available in my area ! The speed is supposed to be 300Mb, I hardly get 50 MB. When I call BT they insist the connection is fine. The connection is unstable at best and often I cannot connect 2 devices let alone what is said in their ad! Can Britain not have better internet than this?"
york,BT,2021-11-09,1 star,1 star,2 stars,1 star,having switched from sky to b t i can not return to sky quickly enough  The whole experience with B T has been dire broadbad wont connect poor set up by engineer phone line wont work  hours and hours on the phone and computer when they did manage to provide a service BAD BAD BAD
Peterborough,BT,2021-11-08,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"Even putting 1 star is better than they deserve. The absolute worst internet I have ever had. Internet speeds ( by them ) were 15mb lower than they said, and my tests were absolutely disgraceful. I work from home so need a stable connection, however it has been impossible to do ANYTHING. Internet speeds showing a whopping 1mb/s (if that sometimes) pages taking years to load, youtube videos buffering on 240p. I have had to work from my friends house the last 2 weeks because of this and it's totally unacceptable. Never ever using BT again, the service is an absolute joke."
Scotland,BT,2021-11-08,1 star,1 star,2 stars,1 star,"Exceptionally poor customer service, I would strongly advise anyone who is seeking a positive outcome and customer satisfaction to look elsewhere, I have been a loyal customer to BT over the last 24 Months paying my direct debts on time and enjoying the service until I made a short term transition into another property one in which the duration was going to be 3 months at the end of this period my service was going to cease, I made this very clear to BT. I have now been hit with an unexpected charge because of the move, I made it very clear to BT that this transition was going to be 3 months so why lie to a loyal customer and not make that loyal customer aware of the line rental charges, a company who supposedly puts ""customers first"" one of their core values, I am now starting to realise why BT do not advertise their Trustpilot score. Because of this experience, I will never recommend BT or any of BT's products to friends or family and I recommend anyone who is reading this to seek an alternative supplier and products."
UK,BT,2021-11-04,1 star,2 stars,1 star,1 star,"The absolute worst. Broadband installation is 38 days overdue after a 3 week delay between account setup and the installation. The only time I get updates is when I call, and some unfortunate (very kind) customer service person has explains that they plan to do it in the next week. They never do. Recommend just about anyone else. Truly awful experience, making working from home and moving house an absolute nightmare."
ABINGDON,BT,2021-11-04,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"This has been by far the worst service I have received from a broadband and tv box provider. 1- The TV Box and hub did not arrive until a week later than the starting date and they did not modify the starting date.2- I was promised the big sport package which includes HD channels and had to call 2 times where they said the problem was fixed but it was not. The guys who talked to me did not what were they talking about.3- The third time I get to talk to someone who knows what was talking about. Also, the problem with my tv changed as well so to see HD channels it was asking to upgrade subscription. When I talk to the BT specialist he agreed that I should have HD but that it was not assigned and that I would have to pay extra money to get it. That is when I decided to cancel. Luckily enough I still was within the 14 days free cancelation Do not want to know about BT ever again.3- The sales guy that promise the package for a certain price was a scam. I honestly do not know how this service can get worst."
London,BT,2021-11-03,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,Absolutely shocking reliability. The worst broadband connection I have ever had. Am moving to Community Fiber
St Albans,BT,2021-11-03,5 stars,5 stars,5 stars,5 stars,"Texted BT am as no house phone or internet. Got automated message saying up to 48hrs to  fix. Just 2hrs later engineers attended and fixed fault in street machinery. Everything working perfectly. Can only speak as I find, brilliant service."
london,BT,2021-10-26,1 star,1 star,3 stars,3 stars,"I have been stuck with BT for a good part of 2 years (almost). Although the speeds were decent enough for the package I had, the termination of my contract resulted in the worst possible ruckus - long story short; the chat team does not know a thing about how to terminate a contract and there is a lack of communication between various sections. I had to waste 3 mornings (2 weeks distance apart) to get someone to place a return order of my router and have my account cancel on my requested date - And when that was done I found out (a month after) that I was still resulting a regular customer and paying the bills regularly...terrified of having to set up an account with them ever again."
scotland,BT,2021-10-25,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"normally i leave a bad company at 1 star but this is completely abysmal.  rating this 1 star would be generous considering what you actually get from BT.  we get our first BT router a few years back, signed for a year or 2 since they promised good connection.  nope!  couldn't even connect to stuff as simple as video or online meeting.  so we phoned them up and asked for an engineer and the engineer came.  the engineer promised high speeds and set us up onto the ""fastest connection possible"".  looking back on that, i almost fell out of my chair laughing with how false that was.  nothing improved and they charged us anyways without any reason or explanation as to why nothing improved.  naturally, we called again and got set up with new internet.  this has been a bit better but not much.  not to mention, there's zero point reaching out to the support team since they're as about as useful as a rock and will just keep you on an endless loop while being as passive-aggressive as humanly possible.  horrible company."
London,BT,2021-10-23,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"BT boardband unstable and bad customer service.  They expect their customers work around their BT engineers schedule not customers.  BT seems to think their customers can take time off work for their engineers.  I don't understand that why BT engineers are not at services at weekend or evening.  Their fault team is a joke, no customer services at all.  Telling me there was no fault when I have no  wifi for a few days, then told me not to talk over him when he was the one kept interrupting me talking.  Shocking bad services at their fault team.  BT management needs to do better to provide some basic infrastructure to the UK public."
Liverpool,BT,2021-10-22,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"Worst broadband u can have! I had a contract with them when I was living in Luton, was ok...ish But here, In Liverpool is pure ****! In weekend is not working at all and during the week I have max 2.8 mb/s so is useless! I am thinking to make a claim because they don't give me what they said in the contract I will get. Waste of money"
Somerset,BT,2021-10-21,,2 stars,,,"Absolutely awful! Paid for full fibre 900Yes 900 to the hub, then a fluctuating poor WiFi, literally often less than 20mb.After 2 hubs and endless calls from bt I bring home my hub from work, a different make (draytec) Absolutely fine, stable, reliable 700 give or take WiFi..  so in short if you want full fibre then expect to pay out for a hub/router that performs Really really shocking how bad bt hub is"
Kirkcaldy,BT,2021-10-19,1 star,2 stars,1 star,5 stars,Broadband is reliably slow!! Virgin is x30 faster than by in my area ???
Oxfordshire,BT,2021-10-18,1 star,1 star,,1 star,"Absolutely disgusting concept of customer service. Was mis-sold a product that was supposed to provide us with internet until an engineer could come out, that then apparently couldn't be provided until after the service had been connected. What a complete waste of time. The people I had the misfortune of dealing with were unpleasant, argumentative and generally unhelpful, wasting an hour and a half of my afternoon for basically no resolution because everyone is busy blaming each other. Communication is poor and aggressive, and the overall experience makes me severely regret choosing to go with BT at all"
Essex,BT,2021-10-13,1 star,1 star,3 stars,1 star,"Really donât know what to say! Had high expectations of bt but they were quickly shattered!The speeds are decentâ¦. normallyâ¦. Up to 130mbs when plugged in to ethernet however the ping/ latency is shocking! It bounces between 4-500+This makes online gaming extremely frustrating and basically unplayable at some times with being kicked out of games randomly, major lag and certain apps just simply not working. This is console and mobile games. My phone signal is non existent so Iâm connected to wifi. When on a call the call often drops. Ironically this has happened multiple times when on the phone to bt. Iâve had them send me multiple external devices which have done nothing. Had engineers come over with the wrong information to begin with then when explaining the problem their response was that they are not trained in latency so they canât help and proceeded to call the bt call centre and go through options that iâve already been through multiple times.Incredibly poor and frustrating service! Canât wait to leave and never come back! Shame on you bt! After reading all these other reviews I honestly canât believe how bad your service actually is across the country!"
Livingston,BT,2021-10-09,1 star,1 star,1 star,1 star,"The worst company eveeeeeer. Problems for 2 months for instalation, later charging me more than they should and extending my ending contract date without any reason. Then calling to finish it and they didn't tell me nothing I needed to send back my router, after month a half receiving email saying if I don't send it back I will get charged after I moved already to another city. Very bad costumer service and Internet working very slow. Never again"
